    defaulting to DSPS package data location

    Parameters
    ----------
    fn : string, optional
        Absolute path to file storing the transmission curve.
        This argument supersedes drn and bn_pat.
        Default is None, in which case DSPS will look in the filters subdirectory
        of the drn stored in the DSPS_DRN environment variable

    bn_pat : string, optional
        Basename pattern of file storing the transmission curve.
        For example, "lsst_r*" or "suprimecam_b*"
        There must exist a uniquely matching file in the input drn.

    drn : string, optional
        Directory to files storing filter transmission curves
        This argument is only used if fn is not supplied
        Default behavior is the filters subdirectory
        of the drn stored in the DSPS_DRN environment variable

    bn : string, optional
        Basename of file storing the filter transmission curve.
        This argument is only used if fn is not supplied

    Returns
    -------
    NamedTuple with 2 entries storing the transmission curve

        wave : ndarray of shape (n, )
            Array of Î»/AA

        transmission : ndarray of shape (n, )
            Fraction of the flux transmitted through the filter
